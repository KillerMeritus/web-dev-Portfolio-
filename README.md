## 🚀 About Me

I'm Vivek — a college student and founder-in-progress passionate about building scalable AI automations that turn repetitive work into seamless systems using AI agents, n8n, and custom-coded solutions.

I've built projects automating sales and marketing workflows, creating personalized outreach systems, and developing AI chatbots for client and team support. Along the way, I'm documenting my journey of learning, building, and experimenting — sharing insights on AI automation, no-code + Python problem-solving, and workflow optimization to help others save time, cut costs, and scale smarter.
